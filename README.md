# sprint_metrics
sprint_metrics pulled via JIRA API


As a Product Manager, I need to understand how engineering time was spent. 
My organization did not have the necessary pre-built reports, so I leveraged JIRA API to write metrics to a CSV. 
With the needed data in the CSV, pivot tables were used to be build visuals for the metrics I care about.
